        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Omurice is a beloved Japanese dish that skillfully combines the flavors of fried rice and a luxurious demi-glace sauce. This culinary delight features a fluffy omelet enveloping a savory rice filling, enhanced by the rich umami notes of the demi-glace sauce. Originating in Japan, omurice has captivated taste buds worldwide with its comforting and delectable appeal.</p>
        <p>To prepare omurice, fragrant fried rice is crafted with diced onions, carrots, and a choice of protein such as chicken or beef. Seasoned with a hint of soy sauce and other spices, the rice becomes a flavorful foundation for the dish. Carefully enveloped within a delicate omelet, the rice showcases a delightful contrast between the creamy exterior and the succulent rice inside. The pièce de résistance is the demi-glace sauce—a velvety reduction sauce crafted from rich stock, aromatic vegetables, and herbs. This heavenly sauce is generously poured over the omurice, infusing each mouthful with a luxurious depth of flavor.</p>   
        <p>Omurice presents a harmonious blend of textures and tastes that tantalize the senses. The fluffy omelet, tender rice, and umami-packed demi-glace sauce combine to create a symphony of flavors that both comfort and inspire. Whether relished as a beloved home-cooked meal or savored in authentic Japanese establishments, omurice showcases the culinary ingenuity that arises from the fusion of diverse cuisines.</p>

            <li>Add the diced onion to the pan and sauté until translucent and slightly caramelized.</li>
            <li>Add the minced garlic to the pan and sauté for an additional minute until fragrant.</li>

            <li>Push the vegetables to one side of the pan and add the chopped chicken to the other side. Cook until the chicken is fully cooked and lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Combine the chicken and vegetables together in the pan and push them to one side.</li>
            <li>Add the cooled jasmine rice to the other side of the pan. Break up any clumps and stir-fry the rice for a few minutes, allowing it to heat through.</li>
            <li>Drizzle soy sauce evenly over the rice, and season with salt and black pepper to taste. Mix well to ensure the flavors are distributed evenly.</li>
            <li>If desired, add a sprinkle of chili flakes or hot sauce for some added spice.</li>
            <li>Optional: Add any additional mixed vegetables (such as peas or corn) to the pan and stir-fry for another minute or until they are heated through.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat and garnish with fresh herbs, such as cilantro or parsley, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Omelette</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk eggs with milk, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick pan and add butter or oil.</li>
            <li>Pour half of the egg mixture into the pan and cook until golden.</li>
            <li>Fold one-third of the omelette towards the center.</li>
            <li>Add more butter or oil to the pan and pour the remaining egg mixture.</li>
            <li>Cook until the bottom is golden and the top is almost set.</li>
            <li>Fold the remaining third of the omelette towards the center.</li>
            <li>Transfer the omelette to a plate, folded side down.</li>
            <li>Optional: Shape the omelette using plastic wrap or a towel.</li>
            <li>Remove the wrap or towel if used.</li>
            <li>Serve the omelette on top of the fried rice.</li>
            <li>Optionally, garnish with tonkatsu sauce or ketchup.</li>
            <li>Slice the omelette before serving.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Demi-glace</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add finely chopped onions to the pan and sauté until they become translucent and slightly caramelized.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle in all-purpose flour and stir continuously for a minute to create a roux.</li>
            <li>Add tomato paste to the pan and continue stirring for another minute to cook off the raw flavor.</li>
            <li>Slowly pour in consommé (beef or chicken) while stirring constantly to incorporate the liquid into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Add tonkatsu sauce, ketchup, and soy sauce to the pan, stirring well to combine.</li>
            <li>Season the sauce with sugar, salt, and black pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>If the sauce becomes too thick, you can add a little more consommé or water to achieve the desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Once the sauce has thickened and the flavors have melded together, remove it from the heat.</li>
            <li>Optional: For a smoother texture, strain the sauce through a fine mesh sieve to remove any lumps or bits of onion.</li>
            <li>The Demi-glace sauce is now ready to be used as a flavorful topping for your omurice.</li>
            <li>Spoon the sauce generously over the fried rice and omelette, or serve it on the side.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your omurice with the delicious Demi-glace sauce!</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Plating</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a portion of the fried rice in the center of a serving plate.</li>
            <li>Using a spatula, shape the rice into a neat mound or make a well in the center for the omelette.</li>
            <li>Carefully slide the cooked omelette onto a cutting board or a clean surface.</li>
            <li>With a sharp knife, make a lengthwise cut down the center of the omelette, stopping just before reaching the end.</li>
            <li>Gently open up the slit to reveal the tender and slightly runny interior of the omelette.</li>
            <li>Transfer the opened omelette and place it on top of the fried rice, covering it partially or entirely.</li>
            <li>If desired, drizzle a generous amount of the Japanese Demi-glace sauce over the omelette and rice, allowing it to cascade down the sides.</li>
            <li>Garnish the dish with a sprinkle of chopped parsley or green onions for a pop of color and freshness.</li>
            <li>Optionally, add a dollop of ketchup or tonkatsu sauce on top of the omelette for additional flavor.</li>
            <li>Serve the Omu-rice immediately while still hot and visually appealing.</li>
            <li>Encourage your guests to break into the omelette, allowing the luscious egg to meld with the flavorful fried rice.</li>
